## Installation
Download the zip file and extract it somewhere where you won't delete it. Create a shortcut of the `UnsplashWallpapers.exe` by right-clicking it and pressing "Create shortcut". Then press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, enter `shell:startup` and drag & drop the shortcut into it. This way, Unsplash Wallpapers will start everytime you boot your machine.

## Source code
The .exe file is just a compiled batch file that runs in the background. The source code can be found at `UnsplashWallpapers.bat`.

## Dependencies
Only `wget`, which is included in the zip file.
